IoT and Web Development

Follow the project instructions in Dropbox.

# Instructions

You can press any of the navbar links or select from dropdown to change the page. You can also view averaged info over preselected timeframes from the other dropdown.

On mainpage you can see datatypes and their values in datatable and latest selected info to the side. The page defaults to showing temperature info. Selecting mainpage or the same dataset repeatedly should persist and not update the page unless needed.

You can use the page from github pages, it should be deployed.

## Self evaluation

I think I did ok I guess? I was planning on doing the extra backend stuff too but I'm moving right now and no one in our team bothered with it so it is what it is. I didn't bother too much with looks but took some insipiration from react and implemented pseudo hooks. So at least there shouldn't be unnecessary updating the page.
